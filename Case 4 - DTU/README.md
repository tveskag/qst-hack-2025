This folder contains the data and scripts needed to build a classifier for photon-number resolving detection.

- **"PSNSPD_data.py" is the main script needed for generating training data.**

- **"QST-Hack-2025 - DTU Physics - Case - Photon Counting.pdf" contains the problem description incluing the target performance of the classifier**

The other files are there to make this script work. Understanding them is not necessary for building the classifier.
- The "8-pixel x photon.csv" files define single and double photon detections, which can be used as reference to ideal photon detection.
- "psnspd.py" defines a class for generating signals with noise from "noise.py" and randomised shifts for each photon. 

"PSNSPD_data.py" works by calling the class defined in "psnspd.py" and parsing an integer to the script returns the desired number of simulated detection signals, as a .csv file, as well as the number of photons corresponding to each signal. 

To use the script, start by installing the required packages in the directory.\
For Shell (on Linux): "python3 -m venv venv && pip3 install -r requirements.txt".

**To generate N signals, run the script like this: "python3 PSNSPD_data.py --signal_no N".\
If no input is given, the default is 100 signals.**

# Update 3
NOTE: the input to the detector should be 1 Gsamp/s, not 50 Gsamp/s. This means that you should call `signal()` with `psnspd.signal(decimate=50)` and not rely on the default value of the `decimate` parameter. 

The computational complexity of the detector algorithm, must be within the capabilities of the AMD ZU9EG fpga, which is capable of 630 GMAC (giga multiply-and-accumulate) operations, where 1 MAC is one 24-bit multiplication plus one 24-bit addition. It is desirable that the implementation is as small as possible, i.e. having computational complexity much below 630 GMAC. When estimating the computational complexity of the Python algorithm assume 1 floating point multiplication = 1 MAC, and all other operations are free.

In the final implementation the algorithm will run on a AMD ZU9EG fpga, which receives 12-bit samples from a 1 Gsamp/s ADC (analog-to-digital converter).

Note to the group in love with FFT: in the final implementation the detector will run in an fpga, which is fully capable of doing FFT. You are fully welcome to start with an FFT and then feed the FFT output to a neural network.

I (Axel) am located in room 251 (though often in room 249) building 307. Welcome to come by if you have questions.
